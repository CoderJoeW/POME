# How to contribute

My hope with POME is that it will develop a great community around it and will grow into its own entity run by the community and not just 1 individual. With that standardized contributions are a must.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit a issue for what changes you will be making
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Code Style
Everyone has their own coding styles but to maintain readability please follow the standards below

### Good
```
if(true){
	return false;
}
```

### Bad
```
if(true)
{
	return false
}
```

Methods,variables, initializers should be in the following format
```
/*
---------------------------------------------------
		BEGIN <Decribe what section contains>
---------------------------------------------------
*/

        #region Private

        #endregion

        #region Public

        #endregion

/*
---------------------------------------------------
		END <Decribe what section contains>
---------------------------------------------------
*/

```
