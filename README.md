**POME** is a SSH Client. When I explain what **POME** is I tell people "Imagine if *Putty* and *Chrome* had a kid, **POME** is that kid". While as of writing this **POME** does not have all the bells or whistles of *Putty* nor *Chrome* **POME** is functional and reliably and is well on its way to being your new go to option!

## Releases
